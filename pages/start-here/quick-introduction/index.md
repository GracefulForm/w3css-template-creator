## Free HTML / CSS Template Maker

Welcome to our w3.css template creation tool! Even though it is beginner-friendly, experienced web designers will appreciate the simplicity, clean code, professional look, and the creation speed.

We prefer using w3.css to other frameworks, such as Bootstrap, because of the very small footprint. W3.css doesn't automatically include lots of files and javascript that you don't need. We've only added 1 script to add better functionality:  A simple vanilla javascript at the bottom to help your menu resize to smaller screens.

Just copy the features that you want to quickly create a new professional website template. 
* Uses the lightweight and easy to edit [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) framework.
* Code comments help you quickly find where to edit colors, text, or images.
* No registration or link back required.
